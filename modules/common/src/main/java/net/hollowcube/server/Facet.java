 * A concept for loading modules of the server, similar-ish to extensions.

 * production, etc).
 * <p>
 * All facets <i>must</i> have a public no-args constructor. There may be other constructors present (eg for use in
 * tests).
 * <p>
 * Common registration functions are provided on {@link ServerWrapper}. These should be used over accessing the
 * {@link ServerProcess} directly, because they can be transparently extended to support unloading facets if this ever
 * becomes a desired behavior (and they have some utilities).
